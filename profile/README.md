This organisation has been created with the intention of uploading, organising and storing 
assignments, papers and other university related documents that I will create.
As of today, I am the only one who "works" in this organization.


# Motivation
Since I recently started my studies at the University of Bonn,
I quickly realised that I would need some sort of directory structure and backup
for all the necessary files (see above).
As a Computer Science student, my first idea was to use Git, obviously.
However, it soon became clear to me that this would only lead to my personal profile
being bloated by tens of repositories of assignments and papers in a few years.
For this reason, I thought that a private organisation to 
strictly separate my private coding projects from my university-related projects
would be a great idea (only time will tell if I was right).

# Goals
Optimally, this organisation will turn out beautifully and in a long term, 
the repositories will be well organised and have a similar and clear structure.
On top of that, by making all my work public, I hope to help not only my future self,
but especially other students, too.
